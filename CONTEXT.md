# Leviosa — Domain Context

Leviosa is a **wellness booking platform** connecting clients with verified wellness professionals (therapists, coaches, practitioners). Clients browse services, book sessions in treatment rooms, and pay through the platform. Partners manage their availability and receive bookings. Administrators oversee the full operation.

## Ubiquitous Language

These are the canonical terms used in code, documentation, and conversation. Use them precisely.

### People & Roles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **User** | Any registered account on the platform. Has a role that governs access. Must be at least 18 years old (see ADR-0012). |
| **Client** | A user who books wellness sessions (role: `standard` or `premium`). |
| **Guest** | A person who books a session without creating an account. Identified by first name, last name, and at least one of email or phone. Guest contact fields are stored encrypted on the Booking. After a successful booking, the confirmation page offers an inline account creation form pre-filled with their booking info — just a password field away. |
| **Premium client** | A client role reserved for future elevated access (discounts, priority booking). Currently follows the same booking flow as a standard client. The distinction will become meaningful when service tiers or exclusive offerings are introduced. |
| **Partner** | A wellness professional who offers services through the platform (role: `partner`). Has a public profile with bio, certifications, and specializations. |
| **Staff** | _(removed)_ — this role was planned for internal ops users but was never fully implemented and has been retired. The `(staff)` frontend route group is the **Partner area** and is accessible to partners and administrators only. |
| **Administrator** | Full platform access including user management, settings, and catalog (role: `administrator`). |

### Services & Pricing

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Category** | A top-level grouping of services (e.g., Massage, Therapy, Coaching). |
| **Product** | A specific wellness service offered by a partner. Has a duration, buffer time, cancellation window, and images. Duration is always a multiple of 10 minutes, between 20 and 240 minutes. |
| **Buffer time** | Mandatory rest/preparation time after a session ends before the next booking can start. Defined on the product. |
| **Cancellation window** | Number of hours before a session within which cancellation is no longer permitted. Defined on the product. |
| **Price** | A Stripe-backed pricing record attached to a product. Can be one-time or recurring (monthly/yearly intervals). |

### Scheduling & Rooms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Building** | A physical location that contains treatment rooms. |
| **Room** | A treatment space within a building. Has a name, capacity, and allocation type. |
| **Allocation** | The assignment of a room to a partner. Two types: `dedicated` (fixed time period, one partner) or `shared` (ongoing availability pool). |
| **Availability** | A time window a partner offers for bookings. Can be a single occurrence or a recurring pattern (daily/weekly/monthly) with an optional end date. |
| **Booking** | A confirmed reservation by a client for a partner's service in a room. The core transactional entity. Tracks payment and progresses through a lifecycle. All bookings are 1-on-1 consultations. In client-facing UI the word "consultation" is used as a synonym, but the domain term and API surface always use "booking". There is no "event" or group-booking type. |
| **Booking status** | The FSM governing a booking's lifecycle: `confirmed → completed | cancelled | no_show`. |
| **Booking claim** | The act of linking past guest bookings to a newly created User account. Triggered silently and automatically when a User registers with the same email or verified phone number that was used for a guest booking. |
| **Booking token** | A signed, time-limited token embedded in the confirmation SMS/email that grants unauthenticated access to a specific booking's status page (`/bookings?token=xxx`). Used by guests to view or cancel their booking without an account. Falls back to manual lookup by booking reference + email/phone. |
| **Earnings** | A read-only financial summary for a partner, derived by aggregating their completed bookings. Includes current-month revenue, last-month revenue, pending amounts, and a per-transaction history. Not a stored entity — computed on demand from the Booking table. |
| **Gap** | Unused time between bookings in a room schedule. The system detects gaps to surface upselling opportunities. |
| **Utilization** | A metric measuring how efficiently a room's time is used (utilization % minus fragmentation penalty). Computed via a materialized view. |
| **10-minute alignment** | All time slots are aligned to 10-minute boundaries for scheduling consistency. |

### Messaging

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Thread** | A private conversation between exactly two users. Identified by its two participants. At most one thread can exist between any pair of users. |
| **Message** | A single text entry in a thread. Body is encrypted at rest via `encx`. |
| **Thread initiation** | Only partners and administrators may open a new thread. A partner may only open a thread with a client with whom they share at least one booking. Clients may read and reply to threads but cannot start them. |
| **Unread count** | The number of messages in a thread not yet read by the current user. Used for nav badge indicators on all roles. |

### Infrastructure Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Session** | An authenticated user's server-side state, stored in Redis and referenced by a secure cookie. |
| **OTP** | One-time password used for email/phone verification steps. Cached in Redis with a TTL. |
| **Pepper** | A 32-byte secret, one per environment, used by `encx` for searchable hashes and password hashing. Kept in Infisical. Losing it invalidates every password. |
| **KEK** | Key-encryption key: the master key, one per environment, held in AWS KMS, that wraps the per-record keys `encx` uses to encrypt fields. Never leaves KMS. |
| **encx** | The internal encryption library. Fields tagged `encx:"encrypt"` are transparently encrypted before persistence. |
| **Contract** | A typed message struct exchanged over RabbitMQ between services. Defined in `internal/common/messaging/contracts/`. |

## Domain Model

```
Category ──< Product ──< Price (Stripe)
                │
                └── Partner (User) ──< Availability
                                          │
Building ──< Room ──< Allocation ─────────┘
                          │
                          └──> Booking <── Client (User)
                                  │
                              Payment (Stripe)
```

### Key invariants

- A **Product** duration must be in `[20, 240]` minutes and a multiple of 10.
- A **Booking** can only be cancelled outside the product's cancellation window.
- A **Room** can have at most one `dedicated` allocation active at any time.
- **Availability** slots and booking start times must align to 10-minute boundaries.
- All PII fields (client/partner notes, building addresses, etc.) are encrypted via `encx` before hitting the database.

## Service Boundaries

Leviosa is a **modular monolith**: one deployed binary, five internal services with hard boundaries. Services communicate synchronously via function calls through port interfaces, and asynchronously via RabbitMQ for notifications and side effects.

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| **authuser** | User registration, OTP verification, session management, partner profiles |
| **catalog** | Categories, products, images (S3), Stripe pricing |
| **booking** | Rooms, buildings, allocations, availabilities, bookings, metrics |
| **settings** | Platform-wide configuration key-value store |
| **notification** | Email and SMS delivery. OTP emails are delivered via direct in-process call from authuser (see ADR-0011). Other notifications (booking confirmations, etc.) use RabbitMQ events. |

---

## Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Auth |
|-------------|---------|------|
| `development` | Local dev, mock user, mock data | `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` |
| `staging` | Integration testing, real services, password-protected | Real cookies, staging KEK and pepper |
| `production` | Public users | Real cookies, production KEK and pepper |

Cookie names, KEKs and peppers differ per environment to prevent cross-contamination.
