## Technology Stack

The project leverages a robust and modern technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability:

- **Frontend:** [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is utilized for building a reactive and efficient user interface, offering a seamless user experience.

- **Backend:** Developed in [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/), the backend provides a high-performance and concurrent server environment, handling business logic and API requests efficiently.

- **Database:** [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) serves as the lightweight relational database, ensuring simplicity and reliability in data storage.

- **Payment Processing:** Integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) enables secure and efficient handling of payment transactions within the application.

- **File Storage:** [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is employed for scalable and durable storage of user-uploaded files and assets.

- **Caching:** [Redis](https://redis.io/) is used to cache frequently accessed data, improving application performance and reducing database load.

## Deployment and Development

To facilitate seamless development and deployment processes, the project includes:

- **Dockerfiles:** Customized Dockerfiles are provided to containerize the application components, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- **Makefiles:** Makefiles are available to automate build processes, streamline tasks, and manage dependencies efficiently.

Detailed instructions on building, deploying, and contributing to the project will be provided in subsequent iterations of this README. As the project evolves, comprehensive documentation will be added to assist developers and users in effectively utilizing and contributing to "Leviosa."
